Project Description:

This project involves the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++. A BST is a hierarchical data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements. In this project, you have the following main components:
        - BSTree.cpp and BSTree.h: These files contain the implementation of the Binary Search Tree class (BSTree) and its member functions. The class handles operations like inserting nodes, removing nodes, searching for nodes, finding the smallest and largest values, calculating the height of the tree, and performing various tree traversal methods (pre-order, in-order, post-order).
        - Node.cpp and Node.h: These files define the Node class, which represents individual nodes within the BST. Each node stores a string value (data), a count to track the frequency of the data, and pointers to its left and right child nodes.
        - main.cpp: This file contains the main program where a user interacts with the BST. Users can insert, remove, search for strings, find the smallest and largest values, calculate the height of subtrees, and print the tree in various orders (pre-order, in-order, post-order) through a menu-driven interface.
        
Overall, this project provides a comprehensive implementation of a Binary Search Tree, allowing users to perform common operations on it. It also demonstrates object-oriented programming principles in C++ by separating the tree logic into a class and node objects for efficient tree manipulation.
